21 DAYS OF JAVA

This repository contains the projects I did on my journey to fine tune my java skills. 

The two major projects are 
1. BioData: This is a simple desktop application implemented using swing library. It records the personal details of members of an organisation to a database and provides an interface to search for recorder memebers. Any of the data fields can be used as a search parameter.
2. (Work in Progress)Brick Breacker: This is my implementation of the popular brick breaker game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Breaker
