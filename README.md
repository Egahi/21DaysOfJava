### 21 DAYS OF JAVA

_This repository contains the projects I did on my journey to fine tune my java skills._ 

My final project for this challenge is BIODATA

BioData is a simple desktop application implemented using swing library. It records the personal details of members of an organisation to a database and provides an interface to search for recorder memebers. Any of the data fields can be used as a search parameter.
